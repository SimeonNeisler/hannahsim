Create a mutable struct ("class") to represent an agent

    "instance variables": 
        "opinion" - an enumerated type which for now is "blue" or "red"
        ("party?" "setting?" brainstorm)


Research how to do basic classical OO stuff in Julia
    - it involves mutable structs instead of classes
    - the methods/functions are a bit weird; figure out how to do that

    "methods": 
        - get/set the opinion
        - choose a random neighbor of yours


Create a random undirected graph using LightGraphs (start with ER; you give it
the number of nodes you want and the prob. of each connection actually being
there)

Make a loop in which you:

    1) Ask "are we at uniformity yet?" If so, done!
    2) Choose an agent at random.
    3) Ask the LG graph for its neighbors.
    4) Choose a random one of the neighbors.
    5) Ask that random dude what its opinion is.
    6) Copy its opinion to the guy you chose in #2.
    7) Lather, rinse, repeat.


Other things:
    - Plot the graphs in an animation (and Stephen can help with this).
    - Capture a history of the sim as it runs. (First cut: every iter of the
      sim, record the % of reds in an array, so we can plot it at the end.)
