SD - Create "params" structure.
HF - Implement the minority influence (MI) model.
SD - Continue to document the BVM and possibly refactor.
HF - Implement other stopping conditions:
        - (already done: uniformity)
        - when no more opinion changes are possible (everyone = their
          neighbors' majority)
        - 10,000 runs (for non-equilibrium cases)
