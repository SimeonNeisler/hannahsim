   - Two pitches were discussed
   - Tentatively, the ideal scenario might be to develop two papers as
   submission to ALife cofnerence and chop the respective papers down to size
   and repackage whatever is on the cutting board for IC2S2
   - Srikanth and Milton are taking the lead on the data mining of ABM
   project
   - Rajesh proposed the spec-proto project
   - We discussed whether spec-proto project is too big

Some personal thoughts

   - We develop threshold models of cooperative group formation in the
   spirit of Granovetter.

We already have it; we only need to repackage



   - Based on a stochastic dynamic, actors accumulate wealth, and form
   resource pooling \textit{proto}-institutions or groups with other agents
   after their wealth crosses a predetermined threshold.

The stochastic dynamic is part of the specnet code. This is also currently
available




   - For various wealth accumulation and group formation protocols,...

This is where Santagio's insights and interests might overlap with the
general direction of the team. What are the various accumulation protocols
that one could think of?



   - we study macroscopic characteristics of the resulting groups like
   their size distribution, and robustness to controlled starvation of this
   population.

These are thing that specnet team already discussed (see github issues)


   - Using group formation protocols where agents can coexist in multiple
   groups lead to emergence of dynamic hypergraph based social networks.

This one is new and maybe overkill for ALife, but as I discussed in the
beginning of today's meeting, this could very well be a IC2S2 pitch, which
can be developed independently into a CSS20 paper.



Tentative teams break down

*Rajesh's pitch:* Rajesh, Santiago
*Srikanth's Pitch: *Srikanth, Milton, Santiago, Rajesh

*Undecided: *Stephen, Hannah, Simeon, Jeff

Are there other pitches that need to be considered? (See below for my
thoughts on Santiago's vision)

*Santiago:* Based *only* on your vision statement, I felt that neither
ALife or IC2S2 were both too trivial for the work you are proposing. Do you
think your ideas can fit into myopic conferences such as the ones under
consideration?

*Stephen: *Are there other ideas that you want to play with?

Overall, I am in it for the fun. So even if the spec-proto does not
materialize, I am happy to jump into any of the others being floated?
