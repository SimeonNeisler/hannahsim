- `influencer` if `true`, makes the randomly selected node change the opinion of its randomly selected neighbor. If `false`, makes its randomly selected neighbor change the opinion of the randomly selected node

- `replacement`: if `true`, puts back the last randomly selected node in the list of next nodes that can be selected. If `false`, takes out the last randomly selected node from the list of next nodes that can be selected.
